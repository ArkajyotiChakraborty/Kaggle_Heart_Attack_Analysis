# Kaggle_Heart_Attack_Analysis
This is a data set that is provided on kaggle, which can be used for practicing the algorithms. 
The Link to the DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

# Implementation:

-> Checking the type of data, info about the data & conforming that data is about classification data.
-> Visual analysis of the data, knowing the category and count by ploting the barplot of every column given in data set.
-> Model implementation:
   1. Logistic Regression
   2. Naive Bayes
   3. K Nearest Neighbours
   4. Support Vector Machine
   5. XGBoost
   6. Decision Tree

The above mentioned algorithms are implemented on the above data set with the following outcomes/observations:
